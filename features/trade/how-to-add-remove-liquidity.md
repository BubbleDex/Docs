# How to Add/Remove Liquidity

"Liquidity" is central to how BubbleSwap's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page.

In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair, and receive LP Tokens you can stake in Farms to earn BUBBLE rewards!

### Adding liquidity

To provide liquidity, you’ll need to commit an amount of any token pair you like. Your lowest value (in USD) of the two tokens will be the limit to the liquidity you can provide.

In this example, we will add liquidity using ETH and DAI.\


**1. Visit the Liquidity page, and click "New Position"**\

And if making a maket above/below than spot price, you will only need one currency to complete the market making, and you will not earn trading fee refund until price is within the price range.\
