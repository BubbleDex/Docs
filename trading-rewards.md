# 💰 Trading Rewards

### How to calculate my transaction reward?

**Trading Rewards** = Personal trading volume/Total trading volume\* BUBBLE output

(Total trading volume refers to the total volume with unclaimed BUBBLE rewards)

### Why are my BUBBLE rewards changing?

Assume that your individual trading volume and the BUBBLE output in the pool are constant from the moment you swap till the time you claim your reward,  the total trading volume is increasing or decreasing, so the number of your BUBBLE reward become less as total volume increases. If there are users claiming the rewards, their trading volume will also be removed from the pool, which means your BUBBLE rewards will increase.

Click **Swap** to conduct the transaction. If there is trading reward for the pair, Click **Claim** to collect the BUBBLE tokens.
