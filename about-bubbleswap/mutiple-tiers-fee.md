# Mutiple Tiers Fee

The V2 version DEX mostly set fixed trading fee, such as 0.30% fee by UniswapV2 and the 0.25% fee by Pancake, which is a reasonable choice, but thatâ€™s not the best choice.

Now DEX is becoming more complex, we are starting to see user preferences for multiple fee tiers

* 0.01%-For stable pairs (USDC-DAI...)
* 0.05%-For stable pairs (USDC-USDT)
* 0.3%-For most token pairs (ETH-USDC)
* 1%-For exotic pairs (BubbleDoge-ETH)
