**Tip: The mnemonic is your "bank card number + password". Anyone who masters the mnemonic can operate all your assets in the wallet on the blockchain! Be sure to use a variety of methods to keep it safe, and never give anyone your private key or mnemonic phrase under any circumstances. If someone asks you for your private key or mnemonic phrase, please report it and ban it immediately.**

Admins will never initiate private chats with you. If someone contacts you directly posing as customer service, please click Block immediately and report it as spam.
