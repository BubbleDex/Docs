# ðŸ‘©ðŸŒ¾ Liquidity Farming

Yield Farming in Farms is a great way to earn BUBBLE rewards on BubbleSwap.

Farms require you to stake two tokens to get LP NFTs, which you then stake in the Farm to earn rewards. This lets you earn BUBBLE while still keeping a position in your other tokens!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Yield farming can give better rewards than just LPs fee, but it comes with a risk of Impermanent Loss. Itâ€™s not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.
